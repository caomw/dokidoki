### More clear logic for AVG game
More clear logic. In the game built by this tool, there exists only 3 main parts: WorldControl, World (contains characters), UI. WorldControl is used for controling the flow of the game. World is the container of apperence in this game world, and also character stands on the stage named world. UI is for setting of the game and in game operation.

As the game proceeds, only actions which written in scripts are excuated.

## How to use it

This tool will be released in the form of Unity3d package, all you need to do is to download this package and import to your Unity project.
